          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>I'm Gerard Degas and I am a software engineer</p>
          <p>
            I grew up learning both French and English as my first languages in
            elementary school in Southern California. I started to think in
            other languages at a very young age. Since then I developed a love
            for learning languages and have always been adept to picking them
            up.
          </p>
          <p>
            After having received my undergraduate degree, I decided to become a
            school teacher. I taught English in Bordeaux, France for a year and
            ultimately came back to the US to teach private high school
            languages, where I taught social sciences and French. After a few
            years I started to feel something lacked in my career as a teacher,
            I lacked the challenges I was seeking. I knew I loved learning
            languages and was always adept working with computers and so I found
            software engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enrolled in a bootcamp in Orange County where I learned how to
            program web applications and graduated in August of 2017. I love
            what I do and have worked previously at Uber and Block building
            exciting products and solving problems at scale.
          </p>
